# Question-Answering with DistilBERT

This repo contains a simple question-answering web app built with [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html) model from Transformers. 
I used a pretrained DistilBERT model from [Hugging Face] (https://huggingface.co/) (:hugs:) and created a Flask API and deployed the app on Heroku. Check out the app at https://bert-qna-model.herokuapp.com/ .

Have fun!
